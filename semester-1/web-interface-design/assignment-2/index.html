            <h2>Topic and it's importance</h2>
            <p>Protected areas, also known as conservation areas, are regions of land or water set aside to preserve the natural environment and its biodiversity.
                These spaces are managed for the conservation of ecosystems, species, and cultural heritage, safeguarding them from human activities like industrial development, deforestation, and pollution.
                By acting as reservoirs of biodiversity and regulating ecological processes, they help buffer against the effects of climate change and support communities that depend on natural resources for their livelihoods.
                In today's world, where environmental challenges are accelerating, protected areas are essential for preserving the planet’s ecological balance and ensuring a healthy future for both people and wildlife.</p>
